# Car Rental Application

## Feature Backlog

- Create popup modal instead of default browser alerts

- Show number of days according to date picker
    
    fixed: onClick(), should be .addEventListener()? <---Ended up using onblur for this so it fires when the element is out of focus
    
    bug: the negative date warning is triggering at odd times.
    
    bug: user shouldn't be able to select a date that's before the current date

- Add (fake) payment integration

- Link info to MongoDB ('data' directory)
